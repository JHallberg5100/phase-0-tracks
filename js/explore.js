// This is a program that will reverse all letters
// It will do this to by taking an input, and then outputting at string that is inverse
// The input and output will be different variables
// First the input will start at the last letter, and then slowly move backwards over each charater.
// That charater will be put in the first part of the output
// then after all has been added, the output will be printed.
