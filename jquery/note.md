Well this sucks.  The whole note I had got deleted while I was writing it.  Goes to show you save early save often.

Jquery is an addition to javascript.  I believe it is a module.  I will have to look into this.  However, the question of the night is how to use jquery properly.

Therefore, I will have to answer a few fundamental questions on this little piece of the coder's toolkit.  They will be displayed below.

##Question Session

  +What is jquery exactly, and why is it better then javascript?
jquery is an extension to javascript, containing functions written to take care of commonly needed tasks.  This is not better then java in so much as it is pre-written javascript.
Because of that, it contains alot of quality of life improvements, and to me seems like an update.  It adds more commands that are just too useful to not have.  
  +What are the best practices, i.e file extensions, formatting reasons, etc.
They are added to an http file, often in the header.  It is written as javascript, but keyed to run then the page is fully loaded.  That means that it can run once the page has loaded, and presumably keep going as page itself remains fully loaded.
So in this regards, it is a vital part of making websites that function as complex programs.  Looking at gmail, the page itself acts as an application.  Without reloading to a different webpage, functions switch out, new icons and words are loaded on, and more information loaded.
So formatting is the same whitespace as you find in most javascript files.  Just make it readable.  Also, note to self, stay on the commenting game.



  +Why does this make one a better programmer.
  Javascript is great.  However, many complex tasks need multiple steps, oftentimes ones that are needed for dozen of other run of the mill tasks.  
  Because jquery has alot of the previously mentioned quality of life increases, it cuts down on alot of the unneeded coding time.  
  As this leads to more time spent actually implementing important parts of the code, it is plain to see why this is a good trait to have.
  Also, it has very good documentation.



  ###Post Study Notes

  The best way I learned to study was youtube tutorials.  It provided on hands learning, as I got to see problems being solves using jquery.
  I seem to learn best that way.  While having large amounts of documentation help, I seem to use it more often as a referance for when I want to code rather then a learning tool.  Basically, understand the reasoning behind it
  Then the concepts of when and why to use it, and its general capabilites.  After that is established, go in and start making things, using the documents as a guide to see if I have any shortcuts to my end goals.
