    <p>But enough of <strong><em>sarcasm</em></strong>.  I do not overly know what to put into here, so instead I will just be writing about carnivals.</p>
    <p>Not much about carnivals honestly.  I don't care that much.  Some are pretty cool though.</p>
    <ol><h4>Carnivals I enjoy</h4>
      <li><p>County fair</p>
        <ul><p>Deep fried stuff everywhere</p></ul>
        <ul><p>Often little concern for safety</p></ul>
        <ul><p>Sometimes have mirror houses</p></ul>
        <ul><p>Classless in an enjoyable way most of the time</p></ul>
      </li>
      <li><p>World Fair</p>
        <ul><p>Also called Columbian Exposition, which is pretty cool</p></ul>
        <ul><p>They gave birth to the ferris wheel, which I still enjoy</p></ul>
        <ul><p>Oftentimes used as a way to show off, at least before the Olympics</p></ul>
        <ul><p>The White City was pretty cool.  My last office had pictures of the exhibits all over</p></ul>
      </li>
      <li><p>Traveling carnivals</p>
        <ul><p>They have those spinny things</p></ul>
        <ul><p>Provide a place for stray children to run away to</p></ul>
        <ul><p>Also provide fodder for murder mysteries</p></ul>
        <ul><p>Sadly I have yet to see a man in a lion pelt lift a dumbell in one hand.</p></ul>

      </li>
