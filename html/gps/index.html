<!--Hello is this a comment.  I will write my reflection here
Semantic tags are mostly used for orginization. Also CSS can go there.  I personally
enjoy the Aside tags, but Im not sure how useful they will be.  I probably use footers and headers the most.
Nav is also pretty handy.

The browser displays elements going down the lines and also going by the parent child relationship.

I do not use sublime.  However, now I am determined to use Atom's featureset to a greater level.

I think the hardest thing for me is just being organized enough to use semantic elements to their fullest potential.
I will need to be better about psuedocoding to fully take advantage of it.
