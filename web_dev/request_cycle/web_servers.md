As I found, there are 9 main tenets of Linux

    Small is Beautiful
    Each Program Does One Thing Well
    Prototype as Soon as Possible
    Choose Portability Over Efficiency
    Store Data in Flat Text Files
    Use Software Leverage
    Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
    Avoid Captive User Interfaces
    Make Every Program a Filter

Basically, Linux and Unix were all about making all the parts of the computer's strength open to operators.
It was that the operator knows what they are doing, so they should have full command over the computer.

A VPS is a walled off example of a computer operating system that is exists on another computer.
Oftentimes they are in dataservers somewhere, and allow people without a large amount of hardware to run a server on some other machine somewhere else.
Or as people like to call it, the cloud.

A person should not use the root directory as that is the master.  Any changes there are changes to the system proper.
